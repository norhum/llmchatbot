      "**Understanding the Context**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **'h'**:  This is likely a very terse reference to a specific part of the video lecture.\n",
      "* **`O.grad = 1`**: This is the initialization of the gradient of an output variable `O` to 1. This is common in backpropagation because the gradient of a variable with respect to itself is 1.\n",
      "* **`O._backward()`**: This strongly suggests that `O` is an object in a computational graph (likely implemented as a custom class). The `_backward()` method triggers the backpropagation process.\n",
      "* **\"After executing o._backward how n.grad value gets updated\"**: The core question is how the gradient of another variable `n` is updated as a result of backpropagation initiated from `O`.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How `n.grad` Gets Updated (General Backpropagation Explanation)**\n",
      "\n",
      "The fundamental idea behind backpropagation is the chain rule of calculus.  Here's a simplified explanation of how `n.grad` would be updated if it's involved in the calculation of `O`:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Computational Graph:**  Imagine a computational graph, which is a network of operations where each node represents an intermediate variable or computation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Relationship Between `n` and `O`:** The question implies `n` was somehow used as input to calculate `O` (possibly through several intermediate operations). For example:\n",
      "\n",
      "   ```\n",
      "   n -> operation1 -> a -> operation2 -> b -> operation3 -> O \n",
      "   ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **`O._backward()`: The Backpropagation Start:** When you call `O._backward()`, it triggers a chain reaction of gradient calculations moving backward through the graph.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Chain Rule:** Let's say `O` depends on variable `b`.  Here's how the chain rule would come into play to calculate the gradients:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   `O.grad` is initialized to 1 (as mentioned in the transcript).\n",
      "    *   During backpropagation, `b.grad` gets updated as  `b.grad = O.grad * derivative of O with respect to b`.\n",
      "    *   The value `b.grad` is stored in `b`.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Propagation to `n`:** This continues moving back through the graph. In this simplified scenario:\n",
      "   * The gradient of `a` will be `a.grad = b.grad * derivative of b with respect to a`.\n",
      "   * Eventually, `n.grad` will be calculated: `n.grad = a.grad * derivative of a with respect to n`.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Accumulation:** The gradient calculated for a node in the graph could contribute to existing gradient if the node is part of a calculation more than once. `n.grad` could be updated by multiple backpropagation paths. If `n.grad` is updated before from another path, the value will be accumulated.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why You Might Not See the Code Explicitly Update `n.grad`**\n",
      "\n",
      "The code you're not seeing might have these characteristics:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Object-Oriented:**  The `_backward()` method is likely part of a class that has methods or properties to calculate derivatives (e.g., a `Tensor` or `Variable` class common in deep learning libraries).\n",
      "*   **Automatic Differentiation:** The `_backward()` method performs automatic differentiation. It's likely that the class is storing and calculating derivatives for all operations in the computational graph. So, rather than explicit code to update `n.grad`, you might see the methods within the class that implicitly calculate all gradients along all the paths.\n",
      "*   **Recursive Structure:** The `_backward()` method might be calling the `_backward()` of the nodes before it on the graph recursively.\n",
      "* **Gradient Accumulation**: During the backpropagation, the gradient of a node might be updated multiple times by different incoming path. The new gradient will add into current gradient.\n",
